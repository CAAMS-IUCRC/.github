# Center for Autonomous Air Mobility and Sensing

The Center for Autonomous Air Mobility and Sensing (CAAMS) is organized under the NSF’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers program (IUCRC). The five-year, multi-university and industry partnership will integrate research from traditional engineering topics such as automatic control, aerodynamics, wireless communication and energy storage with new disciplines such as artificial intelligence, autonomy, machine learning and robotics.

The IUCRC framework is designed to help startups, large corporate partners and government agencies connect directly with university faculty and student researchers to solve common pre-competitive challenges in a low-risk environment. The aim is to develop new technology, leverage resources and – most importantly – build out the U.S. workforce in critical areas through graduate student-led research projects.
